SnapshotPool
* How fast hashing is? switch for lookup
* Trivial case: data itself fits into SnapshotHandle
* Can reuse storage+hashes for {1,2,3,4} bytes, {5,6,7,8} bytes, etc
* HashSet can store liveness bit in entires
  * Storage allocation can reuse 
* Implement common "memory store" with limits
* Support memory limits
* Parametrize with "storage system"
  * Managed array implementation
    * LOH protection?
  * Unmanaged array implementation
    * How to resize?
  * Migrate to unsafe for both impls
* Introduce byte/bitvector APIs for snapshots
* Validate zero-width SnapshotPool
